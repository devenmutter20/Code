  <br>"I spend a lot of time in Paris and every time I'm there, I eat at Take Me Back Cafe. It doesn't look like much, but the food is wonderful. The have a good selection of food other than catfish, and it's all good." -Andie W</br>
<br>"We had 6 people for breakfast and this place was great. We did not leave hungry and everyone commented on how cheap it was for the amount of food we got. We spent $38 for 6 people for breakfast. I would absolutely eat here again. The wait staff was attentive and friendly. It has a small town feel to it." -Russell</br>
<br>"Food was excellent. Service was great and very friendly. And prices was very reasonable." -Christi L.</br>
<br>"This is the kind of place you go where everyone knows everyone. The food is home cooked and appears to be made to order. The prices are very reasonable, the portions ample, and the staff makes you feel right at home. A welcome respite from the normal "feed 'em and shoo 'em out" most restaurants have." -Steve T.</br>
